Diddy-OS Project Specification
Project Overview
Diddy-OS is a simple operating system designed for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. The primary goal of Diddy-OS is to provide a basic operating system that can boot, initialize hardware, and support basic file system operations on an SD card. The project aims to serve as an educational tool for understanding operating system concepts and low-level programming.

Objectives
Boot the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B: Implement a bootloader to initialize the hardware and load the kernel.
Initialize Hardware: Set up essential hardware components, including UART, GPIO, timers, and interrupts.
Support File System Operations: Implement basic file system operations using the FAT32 file system on an SD card.
Provide a Simple Shell: Develop a simple shell to interact with the operating system.
Features
Bootloader:

Initialize the hardware.
Load the kernel into memory.
Transfer control to the kernel.
Kernel:

Initialize UART for serial communication.
Set up GPIO for hardware control.
Configure timers for time management.
Initialize and handle interrupts.
Implement basic memory management.
Support file system operations (FAT32).
File System:

Read and write files on an SD card using the FAT32 file system.
List directory contents.
Create and delete files and directories.
Shell:

Provide a simple command-line interface.
Support basic commands (e.g., ls, cat, echo, rm).
